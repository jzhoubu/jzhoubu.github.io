Hi, I’m Jiawei Zhou, a Ph.D. candidate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Before joining HKUST, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). During my Ph.D., I’ve interned at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab.

My research lies at the intersection of Information Retrieval (IR) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), with a focus on:
- Co-training techniques for integrating IR and LLMs
- End-to-end methods for optimizing real-world RAG applications
