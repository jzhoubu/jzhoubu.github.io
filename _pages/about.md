Hi, I’m Jiawei Zhou, a Ph.D. candidate in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Prior to HKUST, I earned my B.S. in Mathematics from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). During my Ph.D., I have interned at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and Huawai Noah’s Ark Lab. 

My research focus on information retrieval (IR), and retrieval-augmented generation(RAG). My work involves co-training approaches for IR and LLMs and developing end-to-end methods for capturing real-world relevance across diverse tasks and LLM configurations within the RAG framework.
